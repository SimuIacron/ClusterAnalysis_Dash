# Cluster Analysis for SAT Instances

The Repo contains the experimental pipeline for running clustering algorithms on a set of SAT instances
as well as evaluating them.
Furthermore, there are scripts for generating plots based on the clustering and evaulation outputs.

Setup:

  To run the app you need the database files gate.db, base.db and sc2020.db from https://git.scc.kit.edu/fv2117/gbd-data
  Place the database files in a folder and set the environment Variable "DBPATH" to the path of the folder.
  
  Output files generated by clusterings and evaluations are placed in the path given by "EXPPATH".
  Generated plots and csv files are placed in the path given by "TEXPATH"
  
  Please note that some exports require a specific folder structure in the output location to run successfully.
  The input and output paths relative to the environment variables are often declared at the top of the scripts and can
  be modified
